# Integrating-GP-trainee-portfolio-and-website
As a passionate GP trainee with a keen interest in technology and healthcare, I am keen to start project  to enhance the learning experience for GP (General Practitioner) trainees in NHS UK. I am seeking a talented developer to join me in integrating the Fourteenfish (e-portfolio) and RCGP (Royal College of General Practitioner) websites.

The goal is to create a seamless platform where trainees can access educational materials from the RCGP website directly through their FourteenFish e-portfolio. By bridging these two platforms, we can provide trainees with easy access to valuable study resources and enhance their learning journey.

I am looking for a developer who shares my enthusiasm for GP training and technology, and who has experience in API integration and web development. Together, we can build a platform that streamlines the learning process for trainees and empowers them to make the most of these incredible resources.

If you are passionate about healthcare technology, API integration, and improving the educational experience for GP trainees, just respond to me here.
